Problem Statement
The epidemic disease had become the most dangerous disease for the 21st Century. The
infectious disease had still gone through the outbreaks despite of the modern medical treatment.
Model of modern medical treatment has had turned far side due to the epidemic disease
dissemination factors such as the increase of population density and the speedy outbreaks of new
infectious diseases. In this work, we propose a predictive model to predict the status of the
epidemic in the specific region. For the experimental purpose, we collect the data from EHR
(Electronic Health Record) as well as from the social media such as Twitter and Facebook.
